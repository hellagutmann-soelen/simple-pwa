    <h1>Simple PWA</h1>
    <h2>What is PWA?</h2>
    A progressive web app (PWA) is a website that looks and behaves as if it is a mobile app.
    PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features,
    without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally.
    Instead, a PWA can be located with a search engine query and accessed immediately through a browser.

    <h2>About this example</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a super simple example how to integrate PWA for a simple webpage</li>
      <li>It is actual a project which is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/hellagutmann-soelen/simple-pwa">Github</a> and the website itself is being hosted <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify.</a></li>
      <li>Every time the code will be commited and uploaded the Website will be deployed automaticially</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PWA: Not really easy to use for beginners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The PWA API is very huge and complex</li>
      <li>If you technicially write your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaJqMcOMuDM">Service Worker Code</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This project uses <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> which is a super fast and easy to use frontend tooling kit.</li>
      <li>There is a super easy to use <a href="https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/">Vite PWA Plugin</a> to make the PWA experience a lot better</li>
      <li>With vite you can test it locally and build it when you deploy.</li>
      <li>This Github project is connected with Netlify, which means every time you upload your code the deploy process starts automaticially.</li>
